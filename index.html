<body>

<p>My name is Jeannette Low. I am a welder working at John Deere Turf Care in Fuquay-Varina, NC. When I am not working, I attend North Carolina State University (NCSU) part-time as a junior in the Industrial and Systems Engineering program. I intend to graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in Industrial Engineering to apply to a role at John Deere in the future. My hobbies include blacksmithing and speedcubing. I don't have much free time outside of work, school, and hobbies. However, if I can make time for anything else, I do enjoy spending time with my 2 dogs, 2 cats, and pet snake as well as my friends and family.</p>
